# HOW TO PLAY

## UNIVERSAL MECHANICS
- There are three buttons for attacks which can be configured in the button config menu.  These will be referred to as `p` `k` and `s`.  They have different forms if you are standing, crouching, or in the air
- Certain attacks can be cancelled into eachother on landed hits.  Experiment to find out, eventually I'll write it down.
- Hold the direction opposite the opponent to block.
- Hold down to crouch 
- Hold down+back to crouch block.  Some aerial attacks must be blocked while standing, some low attacks must be blocked while crouching
- Press up to jump, press again to double jump.  Adding a direction will cause you to jump in that direction
- Double tap a direction to dash, in the air to airdash
- Press down then immediately up to super jump
- Press `ks` plus forward or back to quickly throw the opponent, which cannot be blocked.  Can be done in the air against aerial attacks
